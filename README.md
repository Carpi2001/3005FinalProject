1. Open pgAdmin4, right click your server of choice, and select Create > Database
2. Give your Database a name of your choice. For this example, I will name it Assignment4.
3. Select the proper owner, usually that is the postgres user that should be there by default.
4. Hit the save button in the window.
5. In the sidebar, right-click the new database and then press Query Tools
6. Near the top, hit the file button, it should open your file viewer. 
7. Navigate to where the assignment files are downloaded and select the ddl.sql files. 
8. You should see text appear in the box. In the top bar hit the run button. The console output below should say "Query returned successfully in X msec."
9. Press the file button again and find the dml.sql file now.
10. Once the text shows up in the box below, hit the run button again. You should get the same message as before. 
11. Next open the query.sql file in the file reader of your choice. 
12. Copy each of the lines individually and run them individually in the query box in pgAdmin4 to test them. The comment above the line should explain what the line is expected to do.
